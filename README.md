About
====================
This site contains R scripts for paper “Dynamics of alternative polyadenylation in single root cells of Arabidopsis thaliana”.

**functions.R**: common functions called by other scripts. 

**cell.annotation.R**: functions for the cell type annotation of Arabidopsis root cells based on gene-cell expression matrix. 

**PA.R**: functions for the integration of poly(A) site expression data from 28 samples, differential analysis of APA dynamics across cell types, and refinement of cell type annotation using DEPAs and APA markers. 

**plot.R**: codes for the figures in the manuscript.
